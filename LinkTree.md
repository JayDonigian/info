### Link Tree View

The `/` character is currently disallowed from bitlink custom backhalfs. That's perfect! If we define a bit of special logic around it, we can open up some really neat features.

Take a look at this list of links in my account:
```
jay-d.me/hiking/new-hampshire/mt-washington
jay-d.me/hiking/colorado/button-rock-mountain-loop
jay-d.me/hiking/colorado/colorado-trail/day-one
jay-d.me/hiking/14ers/longs-peak
jay-d.me/hiking/14ers/crestone-needle
jay-d.me/hiking/14ers/maroon-bells
jay-d.me/roadtrips/2016/07/11
jay-d.me/brewing/lagers/czech-pilsner
jay-d.me/brewing/ales/india-pale-ale
```

Tree View!

### Link-in-Bio for Sub-Trees

Organize a website, completely powered by Bitly.

* Navigating to a sub-tree or "directory" could provide an automatic Link-in-Bio-like view for the links in the sub-tree.
  * For example, navigating to `jay-d.me` with LiB-view enabled:
    * ![Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 12.27.59 PM.png](..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fvar%2Ffolders%2Fbr%2Fgfhq9g_n65bc_pz3fq1rv1hw0000gr%2FT%2FTemporaryItems%2FNSIRD_screencaptureui_yGdBuy%2FScreen%20Shot%202023-01-26%20at%2012.27.59%20PM.png)
  * Navigating to `jay-d.me/hiking` with LiB-view enabled:
    * ![Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 12.32.03 PM.png](..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fvar%2Ffolders%2Fbr%2Fgfhq9g_n65bc_pz3fq1rv1hw0000gr%2FT%2FTemporaryItems%2FNSIRD_screencaptureui_egIEGp%2FScreen%20Shot%202023-01-26%20at%2012.32.03%20PM.png)
  * Navigating to `jay-d.me/hiking/14ers` with LiB-view enabled:
    * ![Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 12.41.54 PM.png](..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fvar%2Ffolders%2Fbr%2Fgfhq9g_n65bc_pz3fq1rv1hw0000gr%2FT%2FTemporaryItems%2FNSIRD_screencaptureui_hZfpdb%2FScreen%20Shot%202023-01-26%20at%2012.41.54%20PM.png)
  * Navigating to `jay-d.me/hiking/14ers/maroon-bells`: https://qrco.de/bdfD37
    * ![Screen Shot 2023-01-26 at 1.14.03 PM.png](..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fvar%2Ffolders%2Fbr%2Fgfhq9g_n65bc_pz3fq1rv1hw0000gr%2FT%2FTemporaryItems%2FNSIRD_screencaptureui_6gUefv%2FScreen%20Shot%202023-01-26%20at%201.14.03%20PM.png)

If we introduce the concept of personal links or password protected links, you could save personal info in an easy to view and host location:
